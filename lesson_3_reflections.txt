When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

-I would create a remote repository when I was working on a project with other people.
I might also create a remote repository if I wanted another copy of my work online in
case my computer was broken or lost.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having 
to automatically stay up to date with your remote repository?

-I might want to work on my own thing for awhile, without having
to worry about what other people in the repository are working on.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.
When would you use one instead of another?

-A fork moves one repository on github to another repository on github.
A clone copies a repository from one location to another, when at least
one of those locations is a local computer. A branch creates a separate
part within one repository. I would use a fork to make changes to someone
else's repository on github if I wanted my changes to also be on github.
I would use clone to copy a repository from github to my local machine.
I would use branch to experiment with a new feature or code design within
a repository on my machine.
