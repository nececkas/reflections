When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

-I would create a remote repository when I was working on a project with other people.
I might also create a remote repository if I wanted another copy of my work online in
case my computer was broken or lost.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having 
to automatically stay up to date with your remote repository?

-I might want to work on my own thing for awhile, without having
to worry about what other people in the repository are working on.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.
When would you use one instead of another?

-A fork moves one repository on github to another repository on github.
A clone copies a repository from one location to another, when at least
one of those locations is a local computer. A branch creates a separate
part within one repository. I would use a fork to make changes to someone
else's repository on github if I wanted my changes to also be on github.
I would use clone to copy a repository from github to my local machine.
I would use branch to experiment with a new feature or code design within
a repository on my machine. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

-I can work on code in the local repository while people work on code in the
github repository, and I can easily check whether the code reflects later.
This might be important if I am working offline.  It might also be important
if I am working on a project that I don't have access to.  I'm still working
this out from lesson 2.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

-I guess I would email files.  It would be sooooo much harder.
